Q: What is this Terraform Assessment repo?
A: This repo is used to assess Terraform code without deploying it. It checks security, correctness, change impact, and policy compliance at plan time.

Q: Are you deploying anything here?
A: No. We only run terraform plan, never terraform apply.

Q: Why do you generate tfplan.json?
A: Terraform plan output is converted to JSON so it can be analyzed programmatically and evaluated by OPA policies.

Q: What policy have you applied in OPA?
A: We have applied a safety policy that blocks any Terraform plan which tries to delete existing resources.

Q: How does OPA decide pass or fail?
A: OPA reads the terraform plan JSON. If it finds a delete action, the policy denies it and the assessment fails. If there are no deletes, it passes.

Q: Where can I see the final decision?
A: The final decision is stored in metadata.json and detailed in opa_decision.json for audit purposes.

Q: Why is this useful in real projects?
A: It prevents accidental or unauthorized destructive changes by enforcing guardrails before infrastructure is applied.

Q:why Tfsec ?
A:What tfsec actually checks

	tfsec looks for things like:
	• Publicly exposed resources	
	• Open security groups
	• Insecure storage settings
	• Missing encryption
	• Weak IAM or access configurations

	It does this without deploying anything.
	
Q:Why ScoutSuite is used in a later stage?
A:ScoutSuite is used to scan the actual cloud environment, not the Terraform code.
Because of this, it makes sense to run it after we understand what Terraform is planning to change.

Q:Why not run ScoutSuite first?
A:Running ScoutSuite first would give us a long list of existing issues without context.
  By running it later, we can compare:
  • What already exists in the cloud
  • What Terraform is planning to change

  This makes the findings more meaningful.
  
Q:How the stages connect (simple logic)?
A:tfsec → checks Terraform code security
 terraform plan → shows intended changes
 OPA → enforces governance on changes
 ScoutSuite → validates real cloud posture after or alongside changes
 
IMP:ScoutSuite is run later because it scans the live cloud environment, while tfsec and OPA work on Terraform code and plan. Running it later gives better context and avoids noise
